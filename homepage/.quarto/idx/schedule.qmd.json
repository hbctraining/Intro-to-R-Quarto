Please **study the contents** and **work through all the code** within the following lessons:\n\n   1. [R Syntax and Data Structure](../docs/02_introR-syntax-and-data-structures.html)\n      <details>\n       <summary><i>Click here for a preview of this lesson</i></summary>\n         <br>In order to utilize R effectively, you will need to understand what types of data you can use in R and also how you can store data in \"objects\" or \"variables\". <br><br>This lesson will cover:<br>\n             - Assigning a value to a object<br>\n             - What types of information can you store in R<br>\n             - What are the different objects that you can use to store data in R<br><br>\n        </details>\n   \n   2. [Functions and Arguments](../docs/03_introR-functions-and-arguments.html)\n      <details>\n       <summary><i>Click here for a preview of this lesson</i></summary>\n         <br>Functions are the basic \"commands\" used in R to get something done. To use functions (denoted by function_name followed by \"()\"), one has to enter some information within the parenthesis and optionally some arguments to change the default behavior of a function. \n         <br>You can also create your own functions! When you want to perform a task or a series of tasks more than once, creating a custom function is the best way to go. \n         <br><br>In this lesson you will explore:<br>\n            - Using built-in functions<br>\n            - Creating your own custom functions<br><br>\n         </details>\n\n   3. [Reading in and inspecting data](../docs/06_reading_and_data_inspection.html)\n      <details>\n       <summary><i>Click here for a preview of this lesson</i></summary>\n         <br>When using R, it is almost a certainty that you will have to bring data into the R environment. <br><br>In this lesson you will learn:<br>\n            - Reading different types (formats) of data<br>\n            - Inspecting the contents and structure of the dataset once you have read it in<br><br>\n        </details>\n\nII. **Complete the exercises**:\n   * Each lesson above contains exercises; please go through each of them.\n   * **Copy over** your solutions into the [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfL04I7TVfs5At3n7OCLBieUsJ8nxZgjbO6mQQwCzKoBG1iLA/viewform?usp=sf_link) the **day before the next class**.\n   \n### Questions?\n* ***If you get stuck due to an error*** while runnning code in the lesson, [email us](mailto:hbctraining@hsph.harvard.edu) \n\n---\n\n## Day 2\n\n| Time            |  Topic  | Instructor |\n|:------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------:|:--------:|\n| 10:00 - 10:50 | Questions about self-learning | All |\n| 10:50 - 11:15 | [In-class exercises](../activities/Day2_activities.html) + [Answer key](../activities/Day2_activities_answer_key.R) | Elizabeth |\n| 11:15 - 12:00 | [Data Wrangling: Subsetting Vectors and Factors](../docs/05_introR-data-wrangling.html) | Will |\n\n### Before the next class:\n\nI. Please **study the contents** and **work through all the code** within the following lessons:\n\n   1. [Packages and libraries](../docs/04_introR_packages.html)\n       <details>\n         <summary><i>Click here for a preview of this lesson</i></summary>\n           <br>Base R is incredibly powerful, but it cannot do everything. R has been built to encourage community involvement in expanding functionality. Thousands of supplemental add-ons, also called \"packages\" have been contributed by the community. Each package comprises of several functions that enable users to perform their desired analysis. <br><br>This lesson will cover:<br>\n             - Descriptions of package repositories<br>\n             - Installing a package<br>\n             - Loading a package<br>\n             - Accessing the documention for your installed packages and getting help<br><br>\n         </details>\n        \n   2. [Data wrangling: data frames, matrices and lists](../docs/07_introR-data-wrangling2.html)\n       <details>\n         <summary><i>Click here for a preview of this lesson</i></summary>\n           <br>In class we covered data wrangling (extracting/subsetting) information from single-dimensional objects (vectors, factors). The next step is to learn how to wrangle data in two-dimensional objects.<br><br>This lesson will cover:<br>\n             - Examining and extracting values from two-dimensional data structures using indices, row names, or column names<br>\n             - Retreiving information from lists<br><br>\n         </details>\n\n   3. [The %in% operator](../docs/08_identifying-matching-elements.html)\n       <details>\n         <summary><i>Click here for a preview of this lesson</i></summary>\n           <br>Very often you will have to compare two vectors to figure out if, and which, values are common between them. The <code>%in%</code> operator can be used for this purpose.<br><br>This lesson will cover:<br>\n             - Implementing the <code>%in%</code> operator to evaluate two vectors<br>\n             - Distinguishing <code>%in%</code> from <code>==</code> and other logical operators<br>\n             - Using <code>any()</code> and <code>all()</code> functions<br><br>\n         </details>\n\n   4. [Reordering and matching](../docs/09_reordering-to-match-datasets.html)\n       <details>\n         <summary><i>Click here for a preview of this lesson</i></summary>\n           <br>Sometimes you will want to rearrange values within a vector (row names or column names). The <code>match()</code> function can be very powerful for this task.<br><br>This lesson will cover:<br>\n             - Maunually rearranging values within a vector<br>\n             - Implementing the <code>match()</code> function to automatically rearrange the values within a vector<br><br>\n         </details>\n\n   5. [Setting up a data frame to plot (+ the `map()` function)](../docs/10_setting_up_to_plot.html)\n       <details>\n         <summary><i>Click here for a preview of this lesson</i></summary>\n           <br>We will be starting with visualization in the next class. To set up for this, you need to create a new metadata data frame with information from the counts data frame. You will need to use a function over every column within the counts data frame iteratively. You could do that manually, but it is error-prone; the <code>map()</code> family of functions makes this more efficient.<br><br>This lesson will cover:<br>\n             - Utilizing <code>map_dbl()</code> to take the average of every column in a data frame<br>\n             - Briefly discuss other functions within the <code>map()</code> family of functions<br>\n             - Create a new data frame for plotting<br><br>\n        </details>\n\nII. **Complete the exercises**:\n   * Each lesson above contains exercises; please go through each of them.\n   * **Copy over** your solutions into the [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSegEjBKDkK4TB7uhNfcBl6633hasPrGsYDnFuH683blpZNtfg/viewform?usp=sf_link) the **day before the next class**.\n\nIII. Prepare for **in-class exercise**:\n   * Download the [animals.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hbctraining/Intro-to-R-flipped/master/data/animals.csv), by right-clicking on the link and \"Save Link As...\" to place the file into the `data` directory.\n   * Read the `.csv` file into your environment and assign it to a variable called `animals`. **Be sure to check that your row names are the different animals.**\n   * Save the R project when you close Rstudio.\n   \n### Questions?\n* ***If you get stuck due to an error*** while runnning code in the lesson, [email us](mailto:hbctraining@hsph.harvard.edu) \n\n---\n\n## Day 3\n\n| Time            |  Topic  | Instructor |\n|:------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------:|:--------:|\n| 10:00 - 10:35 | Questions about self-learning lessons | All |\n| 10:35 - 11:15 | [In-class exercises](../activities/Day3_activities.html) + [Answer key](../activities/Day3_activities_answer_key.R)| Will |\n| 11:15 - 12:00 | [Plotting with the ggplot2 package](../docs/11_ggplot2.html) | Elizabeth |\n\n### Before the next class:\n\nI. Please **study the contents** and **work through all the code** within the following lessons:\n\n   1. [Using custom functions for consistent plots](../docs/11b_Custom_Functions_ggplot2.html)\n      <details>\n        <summary><i>Click here for a preview of this lesson</i></summary>\n          <br>When creating your plots in ggplot2 you may want to have consistent formatting (using <code>theme()</code> functions) across your plots, e.g. if you are generating plots for a manuscript. <br><br>This lesson will cover:<br>\n            - Developing a custom function for creating consistently formatted plots<br>\n        </details>\n   2. [Generating a boxplot with ggplot2](../docs/12_boxplot_exercise.html)\n        <details>\n         <summary><i>Click here for a preview of this lesson</i></summary>\n           <br>Previously, you created a scatterplot using ggplot2. However, ggplot2 can be used to create a very wide variety of plots. One of the other frequently used plots you can create with ggplot2 is a barplot.<br><br>This lesson will cover:<br>\n              - Creating and customizing a barplot using ggplot2<br>\n         </details>\n   3. [Writing to file and exporting plots](../docs/13_exporting_data_and_plots.html)\n         <details>\n            <summary><i>Click here for a preview of this lesson</i></summary>\n             <br>Now that you have completed some analysis in R, you will need to eventually export that work out of R/RStudio. R provides lots of flexibility in what and how you export your data and plots.<br><br>This lesson will cover:<br>\n                - Exporting your figures from R using a variety of file formats<br>\n                - Writing your data from R to a file<br>\n          </details>\n   4.
