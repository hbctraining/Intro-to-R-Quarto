## ggplot2 exercise

# 1. The current axis label text defaults to what we gave as input to geom_point (i.e the column headers). We can change this by **adding additional layers** called xlab() and ylab() for the x- and y-axis, respectively. Add these layers to the current plot such that the x-axis is labeled "Age (days)" and the y-axis is labeled "Mean expression".


# 2. Use the ggtitle() layer to add a title to your plot. 


# 3. Add the following new layer to the plot theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5)).
#  * What does it change?
#  * How many theme() layers can be added to a ggplot code chunk, in your estimation?
